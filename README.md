<b> A 3D-Printed case with wrist rest for the foostan/crkbd keyboard. </b>

This started as a personal project of mine to design and build a comfortable case for the CRKBD/Corne Keyboard by foostan. After several people expressed interest in my build and the files I decided to publish them. 
I can only publish these as non-commercial share-alike because I am using the Autodesk Fusion360 Education Edition which doesn't allow for commercial use of the files. 


Alright here we go, that's how you can get your own case:

You need the [left](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/stl%20Files/case%20and%20wrist%20rest%20left.stl "case and wrist rest left.stl") and [right](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/stl%20Files/case%20and%20wrist%20rest%20right.stl "case and wrist rest right.stl") half of the case, grab these files and get them printed, together with the [left](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/stl%20Files/Insert%20left.stl "Insert left.stl") and [right](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/stl%20Files/case%20and%20wrist%20rest%20right.stl "Insert right.stl") Inserts. I used PLA for the case and TPU for the insert as the TPU does give some sound dampening compared to other materials.

For the weight/bottom I used a lasercut steel plate though other materials should work as well, as does a 3D printed bottom. I found it cheapest to get the same file cut twice, which works great as they are indeed symmetrical. The files are [weight left](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/dxf%20Files/weight%20left.dxf "weight left.dxf") and [weight right](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/dxf%20Files/weight%20right.dxf "weight right.dxf") for laser cutting or machining, and the 3dp files can be found with the others in the [respective folder](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/tree/main/stl%20Files "dxf Files").

The keyboard is sandwich mount, so we need a [plate](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/dxf%20Files/plate%20left.dxf "plate left.dxf") as well, I decided on aluminium for mine but 3d printed, pom, fr4, and the like should work just fine. The plate is symmetrical as well but if someone wants files for both I packed the mirrored half as well. 

To assemble everything you need a few other things, a list of which I have compiled [here](https://github.com/Unicorn-Tulkas/corne-heavy/blob/main/shopping%20list/shoppinglist.md "shoppinglist.md").
